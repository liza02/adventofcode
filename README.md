# adventofcode

I am now 21 years old and it's time to become an adult...so I swapped my advent calendar with chocolates for the code advent calendar !

There is the repo with my writeups of the daily challenges of adventofcode.com 

The purpose of this training is also for me to improve myself in the languages I already know, but also to learn new programming languages.

Langages I already know (in descending order of mastery):
- [ ] Java
- [X] Python
- [ ] Javascript
- [ ] Scala
- [ ] PHP
- [ ] bash
- [ ] C

Langages I don't know and want to try :
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] Ruby
- [ ] Go
- [ ] Groovy
- [ ] C#
- [ ] C++
- [ ] Lua
- [ ] Typescript
- [ ] Perl
